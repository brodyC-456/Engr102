# Discussion: What are some problems with this approach?

# Answer: Tedius, really long variable names, too many variables (not scalable), prone to typos





# OOP Property - Encapsulation: Let's contain all of this data into a single Student class



# Basic structure of a class
class Student:
    # TODO: Let's build this class!
    def __init__(self, id, first_name, last_name, major, graduation_year):
        self.__id = id
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.major = major
        self.graduation_year = graduation_year

    @property
    def id(self):
        return self.__id

    def get_full_name(self):
        return self.first_name + " " + self.last_name
    
    def get_last_four(self):
        string_id = str(self.__id)
        return string_id[-4:]
        
    def print_degree_title(self):
        return "Bachelor's of " + self.major

# TODO: Let's recreate our 3 students as objects of our new class!

student_1 = Student(18584831, "Daniel", "White", "Computer Science", "2026")
student_2 = Student(18582185, "Jennie", "Kim", "Chemistry", "2025")
student_3 = Student(18560931, "Clifford", "Bartholomew", "Marketing", "2030")



# OOP Property Abstraction: The idea of making certain data private
# This prevents other functions/parts of the code from accessing or modifying a value.
    
# TODO: Make the id private.
# Test your code and ensure you cannot access student_1.__id (you should see an error)
    
#print(student_1.__id)


# This is good because it prevents users from modifying the id by accident.
# However, what if they need to see the id?
    
# TODO: Add an @property getter for id
# Test to make sure you can get the id with student_1.id
    
print(student_1.id)
print(student_1.get_full_name())

# What if we want a way to just get the last four of the id instead of the whole thing? We can build a custom class method to do this.
    
# Create a method in the class called get_last_four
# This should return the last four numbers of the id.
    
print(student_1.get_last_four())


# OOP Property - Inheritence:
# A class can inherit from another class.
# The inheriting class is known as a child class
# The class inherited from is known as the parent class
    
# TODO: Create a child class called GradStudent which inherits from the Student class, with the additional property of "specialization"

class GradStudent(Student):
    def __init__ (self, id, first_name, last_name, major, graduation_year, specialization):
        
        super().__init__(id, first_name, last_name, major, graduation_year)
        self.specialization = specialization

    def print_degree_title(self):
        return "Master of " + self.major + " with a specialization in " + self.specialization

# create a new student_4 which uses GradStudent instead.
# this person's major is Computer Science and their Specialization is Artifical Intelligence
    
student_4 = GradStudent(12304567, "Wumbus", "Ploinkers", "Computer Science", "2028", "Artificial Intelligence")


# OOP Property - Polymorphism
# refers to methods/functions/operators with the same name that can be executed on many objects or classes.
    
# for example, maybe we want a method called print_degree_title, which will print "Bachelor of {major}".
# TODO: add the print_degree_title method to the Student class
    
print(student_1.print_degree_title())

# What happens if we run student_4.print_degree_title?
# Yes, it will print "Bachelor of Computer Science".
    
# This is not what we want though, because it should print Master of Computer Science for our graduate school student. 
    
# We can override our parent method in the child class by creating a function with the exact same name: print_degree_title
    
# TODO: Add the print_degree_title to the Graduate class, have it print "Master of {major} with a specialization in {specialization}."
    
print(student_4.print_degree_title())

# Test your code and make sure print_degree_title prints the master's student as intended.
    
# This is the end of the OOP lesson. Look at part_2.py for the follow up to this lesson.
